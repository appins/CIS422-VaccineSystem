Note that there is a similiar guide in the user guide included with this software.
We recommend consulting that guide if you get stuck. There are screenshots
included that should help guide you. The installation section in the user guide is 
can be treated as substitute if you find this one unhelpful.

NOTE: None of our team members used a Mac to develop this project. The MacOS guide
is untested.

Installing Python and needed Python modules:
	1. Download and install the newest version of Python. 
		- This can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/
		- Installation on Linux is typically distribution dependant. On Ubuntu, 
		just type `sudo apt install python3` into a terminal
	2. Open a a terminal (if you're on MacOS or Linux) or command prompt (if you're
	on windows)
	3. Type `python3 -m pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy`
		- If you get an error on Windows that mentions the Microsoft store, please
		instead try `python -m pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy`. If this also does
		not work, please ensure python is installed.

Obtaining the project:
	1. Download the source code for this project. It should be in a .zip format
	2. Unzip or extract the contents using the tool included with your operating system
		- On Windows, right click on the .zip file and click 'extract all'
		- On MacOS, right click on the .zip file and click 'extract selected'
		- On Linux, double click on the archive and follow the archive managers format
	3. Copy the folder onto your desktop. Rename it to 'VDS'.
		- On most Operating Systems, you can rename files and folders by slowly double
		clicking on them
	
Starting the web server:
	1. Ensure you've obtained the project and installed Python as described above.

	Windows: 
		2. Open the folder on your desktop. 
		3. Open the webserver folder. 
		4. Double click the 'start.bat' file (it may only show 'start')
	MacOS/Linux:
		2. Open a terminal
		3. Type `cd ~/Desktop/VDS/webserver; python3 Flaskserver.py || python Flaskserver.py`
		
Viewing the website:
	1. Ensure you've started the web server
	2. Open a browser window
	3. Enter in 127.0.0.1:5000 in the address bar and hit enter

Inserting sample data:
	1. Ensure you've obtained the project and installed Python as described above.
		- The webserver does not need to be running.
	2. Decide on a number of sample vaccinees you'd like to insert into the database.
		- We recommend a small number if you're testing your placement.

	Windows:
		3. Open the folder on your desktop.
		4. Double click insert_sample_data.bat (may appear as insert_sample_data)
		5. Enter the number of sample users you decided on in (2)
	
	MacOS/Linux:
		3. Open a terminal
		4. Type `cd ~/Desktop/VDS; python3 insert_sample_data.py || python insert_sample_data.py`
		5. Enter the number of sample users you decided on in (2)
	
Assign appointments: 
	1. Ensure you've obtained the project and installed Python as described above.
		- The webserver does not need to be running.
		- Technically, you don't need to do anything besides obtain the project
		and get Python installed but for this step to be non-trivial, you should
		insert some sample data or get users to sign up through the web portal
	2. Come up with the number of doses you have recieved.

	Windows:
		3. Open the folder on your desktop (VDS)
		4. Double click appointment_assignment.bad (may appear as appointment_assignment)
		5. Type the number you got in (2).
	
	MacOS/Linux:
		3. Open a terminal
		4. Type `cd ~/Desktop/VDS; python3 appointment_assignment.py || python appointment_assignment.py`
		5. Type the number you got in (2).
	
	6. call_list.csv was just generated. Back it up to a secure location and schedule appointments
	with the users in that file.

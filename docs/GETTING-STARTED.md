# Getting started

### What is VRS?
VRS stands for "Vaccine Registration System," and is a system that
distributes COVID-19 vaccines to those who need them most. The
system strives to be, above all, easy to use. Those who would like
to be vaccinated need only register. These users will be refered to
as 'vaccinees' in later sections.
